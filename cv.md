### About me

Beginner Web Developer.
In past, I was SMM-specialist. Had a lot of cases, even was working with big companies like Samsung, local Construction companies and Hockey Federation.
Also I am a singer. Hosting some events as music cover-group. Now, I am making music with my friend songs as hobby.

I decided to change profession because SMM is underdeveloped in my country. But programming is needed everywhere and my goal is to become Senior Web Developer.

I am honest, motivated and creative with good sense of humor. Able to handle complicated tasks and fast learning new stuff.
